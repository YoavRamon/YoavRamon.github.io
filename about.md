Hi!

I'm based in Tel Aviv and currently working as an Machine Learning Engineer at [Hi Auto](https://hi.auto). I'm the first employee since the startup just got started. if you want to read more about our advancements, follow me at [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yoav-ramon-611718174/).

I try to support the Israeli machine-learning community by organizing the [Speech Recognition Israel Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Speech-Recognition-Israel/) & [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/groups/461707137729175/) groups.

I also write (mostly in Hebrew) about Botany in [Kalanit Magazine](http://www.kalanit.org.il/%D7%A8%D7%99%D7%9B%D7%95%D7%96%D7%99-%D7%97%D7%9C%D7%9E%D7%95%D7%A0%D7%99%D7%AA-%D7%92%D7%93%D7%95%D7%9C%D7%94-%D7%91%D7%94%D7%A8%D7%99-%D7%99%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%A9%D7%9C%D7%99%D7%9D-%D7%90%D7%AA%D7%A8/), in the [Israeli flora site](https://flora.org.il/plants/antpse/) and in the [Hebrew Wikipedia](https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%9E%D7%A9%D7%AA%D7%9E%D7%A9:YoavRamon).

I'm happy to provide consultation to anyone who wants help in the areas of Machine/Deep Learning and Voice technology. If you have any questions or cool projects, fill free to contact me via [Email](mailto:ramonyoav@gmail.com) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/YoavR7).
