This the first time that the ["Speech Recognition Israel"](https://www.meetup.com/Speech-Recognition-Israel/) community is being gathered and we had more than a 100 participants at that meetup. This is our take at creating a vibrant Israeli community that would be home to share ideas and knowledge about speech recognition, audio processing, and any other speech-related tasks. As a principle, all talks are in Hebrew.

I gave a presentation about the process of diarization. The lecture started with 10 minutes about the historical challenges, continued with 10 minutes about the current solution and finished with 10 minutes about the upcoming challenges. You can find the presentation [available online](https://github.com/YoavRamon/Speech-Recognition-Israel/blob/master/Presentations/Meetup_1/Diarization%20in%20Practice.pdf)
